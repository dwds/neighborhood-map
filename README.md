Princeton Height Neighborhood Map
===============================

## What is this?
This is a map of points of interest in the [Princeton Heights neighborhood](http://princetonheightsneighborhood.org/) of St. Louis, MO. It uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and the [Instgram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) to display the most recent public Instagram photo tagged at each location*. It also uses the [KnockoutJS framework](http://knockoutjs.com/) to implement a [model-view-viewmodel pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel).

*After I created this project, Instagram deprecated the part of their API that allows accessing public posts, so that part of the app no longer functions! I have left it in for demonstration purposes.

## Run the app
To run the app, just open the 'index.html' file in a web browser! (You need to be connected to the internet.) Select a location filter from the menu, and click on locations to see photos.

## Who did what?
* [Derek Dadian-Smith](https://github.com/dwds) (that's me) wrote this thing from scratch.
* The app uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [Instgram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/), and [KnockoutJS framework](http://knockoutjs.com/).
