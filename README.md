Princeton Height Neighborhood Map
===============================

## What is this?
This is a map of points of interest in the [Princeton Heights neighborhood](http://princetonheightsneighborhood.org/) of St. Louis, MO. It uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and the [Instgram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) to display the most recent public Instagram photo tagged at each location*. It also uses the [KnockoutJS framework](http://knockoutjs.com/) to implement a [model-view-viewmodel pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel).

*Instagram recently became [rather strict](http://developers.instagram.com/post/145262544121/instagram-platform-update-effective-june-1-2016) about usage of their API. Right now, the app is in Instagram's "sandbox" mode. That means that when using the app, it is as if I (@dwds_) am the only Instagram user that exists, and the only photos that exist are my last 20 posts. If Instagram approves this app, then you will see the most recent public photos from any user.

## Run the app
To run the app, just open the 'index.html' file in a web browser! (You need to be connected to the internet.) Select a location filter from the menu, and click on locations to see photos.

## Who did what?
* [Derek Dadian-Smith](https://github.com/dwds) (that's me) wrote this thing from scratch.
* If the app is approved by Instagram, you will see public Instagram photos with attribution to the user.
* The app uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [Instgram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/), and [KnockoutJS framework](http://knockoutjs.com/).
* The idea and guidance for the app came from [Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1).
